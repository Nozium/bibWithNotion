abstract = {Significance Human sleep phenotypes are diversified by genetic and environmental factors, and a quantitative classification of sleep phenotypes would lead to the advancement of biomedical mechanisms underlying human sleep diversity. To achieve that, a pipeline of data analysis, including a state-of-the-art sleep/wake classification algorithm, the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimension reduction method, and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method, was applied to the 100,000-arm acceleration dataset. This revealed 16 clusters, including seven different insomnia-like phenotypes. This kind of quantitative pipeline of sleep analysis is expected to promote data-based diagnosis of sleep disorders and psychiatric disorders that tend to be complicated by sleep disorders.},

abstract = {The study aimed to explore chronotype-specific effects of two versus four consecutive morning or night shifts on sleep-wake behavior. Sleep debt and social jetlag (a behavioral proxy of circadian misalignment) were estimated from sleep diary data collected for 5 weeks in a within-subject field study of 30 rotating night shift workers (29.9 ± 7.3 years, 60% female). Mixed models were used to examine whether effects of shift sequence length on sleep are dependent on chronotype, testing the interaction between sequence length (two vs. four) and chronotype (determined from sleep diaries). Analyses of two versus four morning shifts showed no significant interaction effects with chronotype. In contrast, increasing the number of night shifts from two to four increased sleep debt in early chronotypes, but decreased sleep debt in late types, with no change in intermediate ones. In early types, the higher sleep debt was due to accumulated sleep loss over four night shifts. In late types, sleep duration did not increase over the course of four night shifts, so that adaptation is unlikely to explain the observed lower sleep debt. Late types instead had increased sleep debt after two night shifts, which was carried over from two preceding morning shifts in this schedule. Including naps did not change the findings. Social jetlag was unaffected by the number of consecutive night shifts. Our results suggest that consecutive night shifts should be limited in early types. For other chronotypes, working four night shifts might be a beneficial alternative to working two morning and two night shifts. Studies should record shift sequences in rotating schedules.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Social jetlag (SJL) is defined as the misalignment between the biological clocks and the social clock imposed by work and social constraints. In order to accomplish the workdays duties, people tend to not respect the internally sleep-wake cycle during the week, often using alarm clock to wake-up, which would lead to a chronic form of travel-induced jetlag. This circadian misalignment has been found to be associated with increased health risk and health-impairing behaviors. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to explore whether the SJL is a valid concept for the travel-induced jetlag symptoms, as well as what is the cutoff point with best parameters for defining the presence of SJL, in a sample of undergraduate students of a university in Southern Brazil. We assessed SJL by the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) and defined the concept as the difference between the midsleep point on free days and the midsleep point on classes days. The gold standard was defined as having at least one travel-induced jetlag symptom (fatigue, sleepiness or difficulty concentrating). Relative SJL, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for different cutoff points, plotted on ROC curves. A total of 452 students with complete sleep information were included in the analysis. The relative SJL mean was 2 h 23 min (SD = 1 h 24 min; range −3 h to 7 h 58 min) and 63.7% of the students had ≥2 h of relative SJL. All the tested cutoff points of the instrument had low sensitivity and specificity values, covering a small area under the ROC curve (0.487). The best parameters were for the cutoff point ≥2 h, with 63.4% sensitivity and 35.9% specificity. SJL did not revealed to be a valid concept for the studied sample comparing it to travel-induced jetlag symptomatology. One possible explanation for the lack of validity of our results regards the fact that SJL may not have the same apparent wide-term effects as the travel-induced jetlag. Then, the symptoms of SJL do not well represent the symptoms of travel-induced jetlag.},

Since epidemiological studies play an important role in public health evaluations, this theoretical paper pursues answers to the question: ‘How can we compute sleep deficiency as informative measures of exposures or doses in observational research?’ Starting from the social jetlag concept and based on the chronodisruption rationale, we illustrate and discuss five approaches (one established and four untested, each with unique strengths and limitations) to quantify sleep deficiency by focusing on the timing and duration of sleep. Hitherto, social jetlag and chronodisruption rationale were neither explicitly proposed nor developed as assessments of sleep deficiency but, as we suggest, could potentially be utilized to this end. This first foray into computing sleep deficiency in epidemiological studies makes clear that laboratory, field and epidemiological collaboration is pre‐requisite to elucidating potential (co‐)causal roles of sleep deficiency in disease endpoints.},

abstract = {Shift work, an essential part of our 24/7 society, inevitably leads to displacement of the habitual sleep period and thereby to misalignment of the internal circadian timing system with the rest-activity cycle and the environment. How interindividual differences in circadian organization affect sleep duration and timing during rotating shift work is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of chronotype, shift type, and their interaction on actigraphy-based sleep behavior in 74 police officers (20 women and 54 men; age [mean ± SD]: 32.1 ± 5.4 years) involved in rotating shift work throughout a 28- to 35-day work cycle consisting of morning, evening, and night shifts. Using linear mixed modeling, we found that chronotype was associated with sleep duration depending on the shift type: increasing morningness was correlated with longer sleep duration during series of consecutive morning shifts, while increasing eveningness was correlated with longer sleep duration during series of evening shifts. During series of night shifts, increasing eveningness was associated with a longer duration of the main sleep episode, but this relationship was attenuated and no longer significant when naps were taken into account due to increased napping in morning chronotypes during series of night shifts. Providing a detailed within-subject characterization of sleep behavior across a complete work cycle consisting of morning, evening, and night shifts, this study advances the understanding of the relationship between chronotype and sleep in rotating shift workers and supports the implementation of work schedules that take into account chronobiological principles.},

abstract = {Many regions and countries are reconsidering their use of Daylight Saving Time (DST) but their approaches differ. Some, like Japan, that have not used DST over the past decades are thinking about introducing this twice-a-year change in clock time, while others want to abolish the switch between DST and Standard Time, but don’t agree which to use: California has proposed keeping perennial DST (i.e., all year round), and the EU debates between perennial Standard Time and perennial DST. Related to the discussion about DST is the discussion to which time zone a country, state or region should belong: the state of Massachusetts in the United States is considering switching to Atlantic Standard Time, i.e., moving the timing of its social clock (local time) 1 h further east (which is equivalent to perennial DST), and Spain is considering leaving the Central European Time to join Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e., moving its social timing 1 h further west. A wave of DST discussions seems to periodically sweep across the world. Although DST has always been a political issue, we need to discuss the biology associated with these decisions because the circadian clock plays a crucial role in how the outcome of these discussions potentially impacts our health and performance. Here, we give the necessary background to understand how the circadian clock, the social clock, the sun clock, time zones, and DST interact. We address numerous fallacies that are propagated by lay people, politicians, and scientists, and we make suggestions of how problems associated with DST and time-zones can be solved based on circadian biology.},

abstract = {The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is the most common measure of sleep quality. Its questions refer to "usual" sleep habits during the last month. Considering how different sleep-wake behavior can be between workdays and work-free days, we hypothesized that sleep quality should show similar differences. We investigated these potential differences in a cross-sectional online study using the original and two adapted versions of the PSQI that replaced "usual" by explicitly referring to sleep on workdays or work-free days. Additionally, we investigated how these scores relate to chronotype and social jetlag assessed by the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire. Participants were recruited online, they had to be older than 18 years, following regular weekly work schedules, and they should not be shift workers. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the three different versions of the PSQI (usual, work, and work-free). To find out whether PSQI score differences could be predicted by chronotype and/or social jetlag a mediation analysis was carried out. Workday PSQI scores were similar to the original "usual" scores, two points higher than the PSQI score on work-free days and above the cutoff designating poor sleep quality. PSQI components and time variables also differed between workdays and work-free days. Chronotype correlated with the difference between PSQI scores on workdays and on work-free days, an association mediated by social jetlag. Our results suggest that the original PSQI predominantly reports sleep quality on workdays and that work schedules may affect sleep quality. The mediation of social jetlag on the association of chronotype and PSQI score differences could mean that not chronotype per se, but rather the collision of an individuals' chronotype with fixed work schedules explains the differences between sleep on workdays and work-free days. Understanding how sleep quality differs between workdays and work-free days, how this difference can adequately be assessed through directing participants to focus on their sleep specifically on workdays vs. work-free days, and how circadian factors modulate this difference, is crucial to improve sleep quality.},

abstract = {An individual’s chronotype reflects how the circadian system embeds itself into the 24-h day with rhythms in physiology, cognition and behavior occurring accordingly earlier or later. In view of an increasing number of people working at unusual times and linked health and safety risks, the wide range in human chronotypes may provide opportunities to allow people to work (and sleep) at times that are in synch with their circadian physiology. We aimed at estimating the distribution of chronotypes in the US population by age and sex. Twelve years (2003–2014) of pooled diary data from the American Time Use Survey were used to calculate chronotype based on mid-point of sleep on weekends (MSFWe, n = 53,689). We observed a near-normal distribution overall and within each age group. The distribution’s mean value is systematically different with age, shifting later during adolescence, showing a peak in ‘lateness’ at ~19 years, and shifting earlier thereafter. Men are typically later chronotypes than women before 40, but earlier types after 40. The greatest differences are observed between 15 and 25 for both sexes, equaling more than 50% of the total chronotype difference across all age groups. The variability in chronotype decreases with age, but is generally higher in males than females. This is the first study to estimate the distribution and prevalence of individual chronotypes in the US population based on a large-scale, nationally representative sample. Our finding that adolescents are on average the latest chronotypes supports delaying school start times to benefit their sleep and circadian alignment. The generally wide range in chronotypes may provide opportunities for tailored work schedules by matching external and internal time, potentially decreasing long- and short-term health and safety risks.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to examine the association of age with chronotype and sleep duration in day workers and rotating shift workers, including night shift work. Between October 2012 and February 2015, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a German chemical company. Using the “Munich ChronoType Questionnaire” (MCTQ), data about sleep onset and sleep offset during workdays and work-free days were retrieved and the chronotype was computed during regular voluntary occupational health check-ups. Associations between age and chronotype, as well as sleep duration, were assessed using linear regression analyses. Potential effect modification by the working time system was examined. Within the study period, 4,040 employees (82.3% and 17.7% were engaged in day work and rotating shift work, respectively) completed the questionnaire. Study participants were on average 41.8 years old (Min = 18.0, Max = 65.0, SD = 10.2) and predominantly male (75.4%). Mean chronotype and overall sleep duration was 03:22 (SD = 54 min) and 7.2 h (SD = 1.0 h) respectively. Older age was associated with earlier chronotype and reduced overall sleep duration in both day workers and rotating shift workers (p < 0.001 for all models). Compared to day workers, employees whom engaged in rotating shift work were later chronotypes and had overall a longer sleep duration. With older age, the difference between day and rotating shift workers regarding chronotype increased, while the difference regarding overall sleep duration decreased (pinteraction<0.005 for both models). This finding could indicate that both changes in circadian physiology and exposure to certain work schedules contribute to the age-related changes. Older rotating shift workers, with early chronotypes may have issues with night shifts, while day work and morning shifts may be best compatible to earlier chronotypes. Differences in sleep timing across age groups, might indicate that the same work hours will affect shift workers differently, dependent on their age, suggesting that more flexible and chronotype-adapted work hours could provide useful; especially for older employees. Sleep education in the form of courses and health campaigns could be a way to raise awareness of the importance of a healthy sleep pattern. This could be achieved by learning strategies to better adjust individual sleep patterns to work hours.},

In the Klokwerk+ cohort study, we included 120 rotating shift workers and 74 non‐shift workers who were recruited from six Dutch hospitals. Participants wore Actigraph GT3X accelerometers for 24 hr for 7 days. From the Actigraph data, we predicted the sleep duration and social jetlag (measure of circadian misalignment). Mixed models and generalized estimation equations were used to compare the sleep parameters between shift and non‐shift workers. Within shift workers, sleep on different shifts was compared with sleep on work‐free days. Differences by chronotype and age were investigated using interaction terms. On workdays, shift workers had 3.5 times (95% confidence interval: 2.2–5.4) more often a short (< 7 hr per day) and 4.1 times (95% confidence interval: 2.5–6.8) more often a long (≥ 9 hr per day) sleep duration compared with non‐shift workers. This increased odds ratio was present in morning chronotypes, but not in evening chronotypes (interaction p‐value < .05). Older shift workers (≥ 50 years) had 7.3 times (95% confidence interval: 2.5–21.8) more often shorter sleep duration between night shifts compared with work‐free days, while this was not the case in younger shift workers (< 50 years). Social jetlag due to night shifts increased with increasing age (interaction p‐value < .05), but did not differ by chronotype (interaction p‐value ≥ .05). In conclusion, shift workers, in particular older workers and morning chronotypes, experienced more sleep disturbances than non‐shift workers. Future research should elucidate whether these sleep disturbances contribute to shift work‐related health problems.},

abstract = {Shift workers are at risk for developing serious health issues due to short sleep. One cause of short sleep is circadian misalignment: sleep time is not synchronized with the body’s natural circadian rhythms. Although circadian rhythms are strongly driven by the light/dark cycle, humans have individualized sleep time preferences (chronotypes) based on genetics, development, and external influences. Evening chronotype individuals fall asleep later than average and have a higher risk for developing various noncommunicable diseases. What is unclear is the association between chronotype, shift work, and risks for acquiring chronic conditions. This review is focused on shift worker chronotype and associations with obesity. Because of the paucity of research, other health issues connected with circadian misalignment were included, allowing for a total of 21 research studies. Evidence from this review supports chronotype and certain health issues are associated with shift work, even after adjusting for short sleep duration. In addition, there is evidence to support future research on how shift worker chronotype matched with shift timing impacts worker health. Through better understanding of this interface, occupational health providers can provide more comprehensive worker education on the risks associated with shift work and sleep disturbances.},

abstract = {Within the human population, there is large interindividual variability in the timing of sleep and circadian rhythms. This variability has been attributed to individual differences in sleep physiology, circadian physiology, and/or light exposure. Recent experimental evidence suggests that the latter is necessary to evoke large interindividual differences in sleep and circadian timing. We used a validated model of human sleep and circadian physiology to test the hypothesis that intrinsic differences in sleep and circadian timing are amplified by self-selected use of artificial light sources. We tested the model under 2 conditions motivated by an experimental study (Wright et al., 2013): (1) a “natural” light cycle, and (2) a “realistic” light cycle that included attenuation of light due to living indoors when natural light levels are high and use of electric light when natural light levels are low. Within these conditions, we determined the relationship between intrinsic circadian period (within the range of 23.7-24.6 h) and timing of sleep onset, sleep offset, and circadian rhythms. In addition, we simulated a work week, with fixed wake time for 5 days and free sleep times on weekends. Under both conditions, a longer intrinsic period resulted in later sleep and circadian timing. Compared to the natural condition, the realistic condition evoked more than double the variation in sleep timing across the physiological range of intrinsic circadian periods. Model predictions closely matched data from the experimental study. We found that if the intrinsic circadian period was long (>24.2 h) under the realistic condition, there was significant mismatch in sleep timing between weekdays and weekends, which is known as social jetlag. These findings indicate that individual tendencies to have very delayed schedules can be greatly amplified by self-selected modifications to the natural light/dark cycle. This has important implications for therapeutic treatment of advanced or delayed sleep phase disorders.},

Besides being used as a method to correlate circadian features of human biology with other factors—ranging from health issues to geographical factors—the MCTQ gave rise to the quantification of old wisdoms, like “teenagers are late”, and has produced new concepts, like social jetlag. Some like the MCTQ’s simplicity and some view it critically. Therefore, it is time to present a self-critical view on the MCTQ, to address some misunderstandings, and give some definitions of the MCTQ-derived chronotype and the concept of social jetlag.},

abstract = {Rhythmic hormonal secretion is key for sustaining health. While a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus is the main driver of circadian periodicity, many hormones oscillate with different frequencies and amplitudes. These rhythms carry information about healthy physiological functions, while at the same time they must be able to respond to external cues and maintain their robustness against severe perturbations. Since endocrine disruptions can lead to hormonal misalignment and disease, understanding the clinical significance of these rhythms can help support diagnosis and disease management. While the misalignment of dynamic hormone profiles can be quantitatively analysed though statistical and computational techniques, mathematical modelling can provide fundamental understanding about the mechanisms underpinning endocrine rhythms, particularly around the question of what makes them robust to some perturbations but fragile to others. In this study, I will review the key challenges of understanding hormonal rhythm misalignment from a mathematical perspective, including their causes and clinical significance. By reviewing modelling examples of coupled endocrine axes, I will address the question of how perturbations in one endocrine axis propagate to another, leading to the more complex issue of disentangling the contribution of each endocrine system to a robust dynamic environment.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a new active electrode design for electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors based on inertial measurement units to remove motion artefacts during signal acquisition. Rather than measuring motion data from a single source for the entire recording unit, inertial measurement units are attached to each individual EEG or ECG electrode to collect local movement data. This data is then used to remove the motion artefact by using normalised least mean square adaptive filtering. Results show that the proposed active electrode design can reduce motion contamination from EEG and ECG signals in chest movement and head swinging motion scenarios. However, it is found that the performance varies, necessitating the need for the algorithm to be paired with more sophisticated signal processing to identify scenarios where it is beneficial in terms of improving signal quality. The new instrumentation hardware allows data driven artefact removal to be performed, providing a new data driven approach compared to widely used blind‐source separation methods, and helps enable in the wild EEG recordings to be performed.},

abstract = {Presentation attacks are falsified biometric traits presented on biometric systems to deceive them. While biometric systems can be tuned and modified to reliably detect known presentation attacks, their performance significantly degrades when encountering unknown presentation attacks. In this article, we propose a new approach toward detecting unknown presentation attacks based on the measurement and characterization of synchrony between multiple physiological signals obtained from contact and contactless sensors. Synchrony between two physiological signals was captured by analyzing the blood flow dynamics and respiration patterns. The instantaneous phase difference between two physiological signals was represented as a phase vector using the Hilbert transform and the degree of phase coherence defined as the absolute mean of phase vectors over the analysis period was used as a measure of synchrony. A weighted k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier was then designed to detect valid and invalid biometric presentations based on the degree of phase coherence. The proposed method was validated on the detection of synchrony between two respiration patterns obtained through the measurement of chest movements using an ultrawideband (UWB) radar and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) using a finger photoplethysmogram sensor on data collected from 50 individuals. It achieved a high accuracy of 95.3%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 94% in detecting corrupted and nonsynchronous patterns that did not contain valid respiration signatures. The proposed method shows promise toward improving the reliability of biometric systems in the detection of unknown and sophisticated attacks that may spoof one or more of the presented biometrics.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Chronotypes are associated with shift work tolerance and sleep in shift workers, and sleep mediates the impact of shift work on mental health. However, the role of chronotype in the association between shift work and mental health has not been clarified. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronotype and burnout in shift workers, using the validated Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for shift workers (MCTQshift). A total of 288 shift workers with irregular shift frequencies were recruited and completed the Chinese-version MCTQshift and the Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Chronotypes were assessed by the calculation of corrected mid-sleep time (MSFSC) from mid-sleep time on free days (MSF) based on their exact shift schedules. Another 26 evening-shift nurses were monitored with actigraphy for at least two consecutive evening shifts and the following two free days. Burnout was evaluated using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. We found that MSFESC, MSFE and mid-sleep time on workdays (MSWE) had normal distributions and correlated significantly with MEQ scores (r = − 0.47, −0.45 and −0.47, respectively; all p < 0.001). MSW was more closely correlated with actigraphy-derived mid-sleep time on the free day before workdays than that on workdays (r = 0.61 and 0.48, respectively, p < 0.05). Sleep duration was significantly longer on workdays among evening-shift workers who slept late on workdays than those who slept early (β = 0.59, p < 0.001). After demographic and work characteristics were adjusted for in linear regression models, late chronotype and high social jetlag were associated with burnout scores in evening-shift workers. In conclusion, the Chinese-version MCTQshift is a valid tool for chronotype assessment. Interventions to improve sleep in shift workers should be tailored to chronotype due to variations in sleep behavior. Late chronotype may be an inherent feature of mental health problems, because the association with burnout was significant in both day workers in previous studies and shift workers.},

abstract = {Individuals vary in how their circadian system synchronizes with the cyclic environment (zeitgeber). Assessing these differences in “phase of entrainment”—often referred to as chronotype—is an important procedure in laboratory experiments and epidemiological studies but is also increasingly applied in circadian medicine, both in diagnosis and therapy. While biochemical measurements (e.g., dim-light melatonin onset [DLMO]) of internal time are still the gold standard, they are laborious, expensive, and mostly rely on special conditions (e.g., dim light). Chronotype estimation in the form of questionnaires is useful in approximating the timing of an individual’s circadian clock. They are simple, inexpensive, and location independent (e.g., administrable on- and offline) and can therefore be easily administered to many individuals. The Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) is an established instrument to assess chronotype by asking subjects about their sleep-wake-behavior. Here we present a shortened version of the MCTQ, the µMCTQ, for use in situations in which instrument length is critical, such as in large cohort studies. The µMCTQ contains only the core chronotype module of the standard MCTQ (stdMCTQ), which was shortened and adapted from 17 to 6 essential questions, allowing for a quick assessment of chronotype and other related parameters such as social jetlag and sleep duration. µMCTQ results correspond well to the ones collected by the stdMCTQ and are externally validated by actimetry and DLMO, assessed at home (no measure of compliance). Sleep onset, midpoint of sleep, and the µMCTQ-derived marker of chronotype showed slight deviations toward earlier times in the µMCTQ when compared with the stdMCTQ (<35 min). The µMCTQ assessment of chronotype showed good test-retest reliability and correlated significantly with phase markers from actimetry and melatonin (DLMO), especially with measurements taken on work-free days. Because of its brevity, the µMCTQ represents an ideal tool to estimate individual internal time in time-critical contexts, from large cohort studies to individualized medicine.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Fatigue is recognized as an important safety concern in the transportation industry. In this study, our goal was to investigate how circadian and sleep–wake dependent factors influence St-Lawrence River pilots’ sleep–wake cycle, alertness and psychomotor performance levels at work. A total of 18 male St-Lawrence River ship pilots were recruited to a 16–21-day field study. Pilots’ chronotype, sleepiness and insomnia levels were documented using standardized questionnaires. Their sleep–wake cycle was documented by a sleep–wake log and wrist-worn activity monitoring. Subjective alertness and objective psychomotor performances were assessed ~5×/day for each work and rest day. Ship transits were distributed throughout the 24-h day and lasted on average (± SEM) 5.93 ± 0.67 h. Main sleep periods occurred mainly at night, and objectively lasted 6.04 ± 1.02 h before work days. When going to bed at the end of work days, pilots subjectively reported sleeping 7.64 ± 1.64 h in the prior 24 h. Significant diurnal and wake-dependent effects were observed for subjective alertness and objective psychomotor performance, with minimum levels occurring between 09:00 and 10:00. Thus, despite their irregular work schedule, ship pilots presented, as a group, a diurnal variation of alertness and psychomotor performance indicative of a day-oriented circadian system. Important inter-individual differences were observed on psychomotor performance mesor and phase. In individuals, earlier phases in psychomotor performance were correlated with earlier chronotype. This study indicates that both circadian and homeostatic processes modulate alertness and psychomotor performance levels with worst levels reached when long shifts ended in the morning. This work has potential applications as it indicates fatigue countermeasures considering both processes are scientifically based.},
