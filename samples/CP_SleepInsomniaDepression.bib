abstract = {INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.


METHODS
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.


RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tryptophan as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use valerian as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).},

Current first-line treatments include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Despite significant success, a number of patients do not benefit sufficiently. Progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of the neurobiology of insomnia and hypersomnia. This work summarizes current concepts of the regulation of arousal and sleep and its modulation through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic, current, and auditory stimulation. Particularly, we suggest: (1) characterization of patients with sleep problems – across diagnostic entities of mental disorders – based on specific alterations of sleep, including alterations of sleep slow waves, sleep spindles, cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations, local sleep-wake regulation, and REM sleep and (2) targeting these with specific NIBS techniques. While evidence is accumulating that the modulation of specific alterations of sleep through NIBS is feasible, it remains to be tested whether this translates to clinically relevant effects and new treatment developments.},

abstract = {Insomnia poses significant challenges to public health. It is a common condition associated with marked impairment in function and quality of life, psychiatric and physical morbidity, and accidents. As such, it is important that effective treatment is provided in clinical practice. To this end, this paper reviews critical aspects of the assessment of insomnia and the available treatment options. These options include both non‐medication treatments, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and a variety of pharmacologic therapies such as benzodiazepines, “z‐drugs”, melatonin receptor agonists, selective histamine H1 antagonists, orexin antagonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and non‐selective antihistamines. A review of the available research indicates that rigorous double‐blind, randomized, controlled trials are lacking for some of the most commonly administered insomnia therapies. However, there are an array of interventions which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in insomnia in trials with the above features, and whose risk/benefit profiles have been well characterized. These interventions can form the basis for systematic, evidence‐based treatment of insomnia in clinical practice. We review this evidence base and highlight areas where more studies are needed, with the aim of providing a resource for improving the clinical management of the many patients with insomnia.},

Method Searches were performed from inception to February 2020, reporting on the effects of BBTI using randomized controlled trials (RCT) (adults aged 32 to 84). The main outcome measures were sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE%), and total sleep time (TST). Results BBTI showed improved SOL compared with control group in mean difference at early (−15.42 [95% CI: −33.05 to −12.01; I2 =49%]) and late follow-up (-10.52 [95% CI: −1.12 to 0.54; I2=93%]). This was statistically significant at early follow-up, but not at late follow-up. The improvement of WASO by BBTI over the control group was shown at early follow-up (-17.47 [95% CI: −2.67 to 0.45; I2=90%]), and was statistically significant. For WASO, a non-statistically significant improvement of BBTI over the control group was shown at late follow-up (-12.77 [95% CI: −22.47 to -3.08; I2=0%]). SE% was shown improved statistically significant by BBTI over control group at early (4.47 [95% CI: −0.35 to 9.29; I2=98%]) and at late follow-up (6.52 [95% CI: −4.00 to 17.05; I2=89%]). The TST was shown no improvement by BBTI at early follow-up in mean difference (-2.97 [95% CI −38.83 to 32.90; I2=96%]). At late follow-up, TST was shown improvement in BBTI with mean difference (14.52 [95% CI: −31.64 to 60.68; I2=94%]) compared with the control group. Conclusion Current evidence suggests that BBTI can be considered preliminarily efficacious and can be used for samples of middle-aged and older adults.},

abstract = {Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self‐report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive‐behavioural models to (epi‐) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep–wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive‐behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first‐line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive‐behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non‐response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders.},

Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia may provide important information regarding how, and under what conditions, the disorder develops and is maintained as well as potential targets for prevention and treatment. The aims of this report are (1) to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiology of insomnia and (2) to present a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that considers evidence from various domains of research. Working within several models of insomnia, evidence for the pathophysiology of the disorder is presented across levels of analysis, from genetic to molecular and cellular mechanisms, neural circuitry, physiologic mechanisms, sleep behavior, and self-report.

abstract = {Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide, confers marked risks for both physical and mental health. Furthermore, insomnia is associated with considerable direct and indirect healthcare costs. Recent guidelines in the US and Europe unequivocally conclude that cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I) should be the first‐line treatment for the disorder. Current treatment approaches are in stark contrast to these clear recommendations, not least across Europe, where, if any treatment at all is delivered, hypnotic medication still is the dominant therapeutic modality. To address this situation, a Task Force of the European Sleep Research Society and the European Insomnia Network met in May 2018. The Task Force proposed establishing a European CBT‐I Academy that would enable a Europe‐wide system of standardized CBT‐I training and training centre accreditation. This article summarizes the deliberations of the Task Force concerning definition and ingredients of CBT‐I, preconditions for health professionals to teach CBT‐I, the way in which CBT‐I should be taught, who should be taught CBT‐I and to whom CBT‐I should be administered. Furthermore, diverse aspects of CBT‐I care and delivery were discussed and incorporated into a stepped‐care model for insomnia.},

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co‐morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate‐ to high‐quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep‐related breathing disorders), in treatment‐resistant insomnia, for professional at‐risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high‐quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first‐line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high‐quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and some antidepressants are effective in the short‐term treatment of insomnia (≤4 weeks; weak recommendation, moderate‐quality evidence). Antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin and phytotherapeutics are not recommended for insomnia treatment (strong to weak recommendations, low‐ to very‐low‐quality evidence). Light therapy and exercise need to be further evaluated to judge their usefulness in the treatment of insomnia (weak recommendation, low‐quality evidence). Complementary and alternative treatments (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not recommended for insomnia treatment (weak recommendation, very‐low‐quality evidence).},

abstract = {Chronic insomnia afflicts approximately 10% of the adult population and is associated with daytime impairments and an elevated risk for developing somatic and mental disorders. Current pathophysiological models propose a persistent hyperarousal on the cognitive, emotional and physiological levels. However, the marked discrepancy between minor objective alterations in standard parameters of sleep continuity and the profound subjective impairment in patients with insomnia is unresolved. We propose that "instability" of REM sleep contributes to the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep and to the explanation of this discrepancy. This concept is based on evidence showing increased micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep in insomnia patients. As REM sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep it seems particularly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. The continuity hypothesis of dream production suggests that pre-sleep concerns of patients with insomnia, i. e., worries about poor sleep and its consequences, dominate their dream content. Enhanced arousal during REM sleep may render these wake-like cognitions more accessible to conscious perception, memory storage and morning recall, resulting in the experience of disrupted and non-restorative sleep. Furthermore, chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunction in a ventral emotional neural network, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This dysfunction, along with attenuated functioning in a dorsal executive neural network, including frontal and prefrontal areas, might contribute to emotional and cognitive alterations and an elevated risk of developing depression.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the most prominent nonpharmacologic treatment for insomnia disorders. Although meta-analyses have examined primary insomnia, less is known about the comparative efficacy of CBT-I on comorbid insomnia.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the efficacy of CBT-I for insomnia comorbid with psychiatric and/or medical conditions for (1) remission from insomnia; (2) self-reported sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, and subjective sleep quality; and (3) comorbid symptoms.


DATA SOURCES
A systematic search was conducted on June 2, 2014, through PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and manual searches. Search terms included (1) CBT-I or CBT or cognitive behavioral [and its variations] or behavioral therapy [and its variations] or behavioral sleep medicine or stimulus control or sleep restriction or relaxation therapy or relaxation training or progressive muscle relaxation or paradoxical intention; and (2) insomnia or sleep disturbance.


STUDY SELECTION
Studies were included if they were randomized clinical trials with at least one CBT-I arm and had an adult population meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia as well as a concomitant condition. Inclusion in final analyses (37 studies) was based on consensus between 3 authors' independent screenings.


DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS
Data were independently extracted by 2 authors and pooled using a random-effects model. Study quality was independently evaluated by 2 authors using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
A priori main outcomes (ie, clinical sleep and comorbid outcomes) were derived from sleep diary and other self-report measures.


RESULTS
At posttreatment evaluation, 36.0% of patients who received CBT-I were in remission from insomnia compared with 16.9% of those in control or comparison conditions (pooled odds ratio, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.30-4.68; P < .001). Pretreatment and posttreatment controlled effect sizes were medium to large for most sleep parameters (sleep efficiency: Hedges g = 0.91 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.08]; sleep onset latency: Hedges g = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00]; wake after sleep onset: Hedges g = 0.68; sleep quality: Hedges g = 0.84; all P < .001), except total sleep time. Comorbid outcomes yielded a small effect size (Hedges g = 0.39 [95% CI, 0.60-0.98]; P < .001); improvements were greater in psychiatric than in medical populations (Hedges g = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.09-0.30]; χ2 test for interaction = 12.30; P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is efficacious for improving insomnia symptoms and sleep parameters for patients with comorbid insomnia. A small to medium positive effect was found across comorbid outcomes, with larger effects on psychiatric conditions compared with medical conditions. Large-scale studies with more rigorous designs to reduce detection and performance bias are needed to improve the quality of the evidence.},

abstract = {Sleep problems are common and associated with a decline in overall and sleep-related health (13). Insomnia is more common in women and older adults (4). Aging is often accompanied by disrupted sleep and frequent and early waking (5, 6). Other conditions coexist with, are due to, or lead to poor sleep (7). Insomnia symptoms are typically transient and may not cause distress or impaired activity. However, insomnia disorder as defined by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, requires sleep problems that are chronic, persistent, and associated with daytime dysfunction. Insomnia disorder includes a predominant symptom of difficulty with sleep initiation, difficulty maintaining sleep, or early-morning waking with inability to return to sleep causing clinically significant distress or impairment in activities, occurring at least 3 nights per week. Current definitions require insomnia symptoms to have persisted for 3 months or more (8). Individuals must have adequate opportunity for sleep, and symptoms must not be better explained by another sleep disorder, effects of a substance, or other medical or mental conditions. Treatment goals include meaningful improvements in sleep-associated distress or dysfunction (global outcomes). The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index measure both problems and worry about sleep and accompanying distress or dysfunction. Sleep measures are based on specific sleep variables that can be assessed in a sleep laboratory with polysomnography or actigraphy or subjectively with patient-reported sleep diaries. These include sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed sleeping). In general, insomnia disorder is treated by clinicians on the basis of patient-reported sleep-associated distress, not laboratory assessment. Additionally, polysomnography is not indicated for the diagnosis or treatment of insomnia disorder (9). Prescription medications are often used. Several are approved for insomnia, typically for short-term use, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although medication indications often focus on specific sleep variables, it is not known how frequently primary care physicians target medications to specific or global measures of insomnia or prescribe them long term. We evaluated the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of pharmacologic interventions for insomnia disorder. An accompanying article assesses psychological and behavioral interventions (10). These articles summarize findings from a report conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality/Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center (11). The work served, in part, as the evidence base for an American College of Physicians' clinical practice guideline. Methods We developed and followed a standard protocol. The protocol was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (registration number: CRD42014009908) in May 2014 and published at http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&productid=1888. Full details of the findings and evidence tables are available in the report (11). Data Sources and Searches We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PSYCinfo from 2004 through September 2015 for relevant English-language literature (Table 1 of the Supplement), reference lists of pertinent studies, FDA Web sites and product labels, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Supplement. Data Supplement Study Selection Two investigators independently reviewed titles and abstracts of search results and screened the full text of potentially eligible English-language references. We included randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacologic therapies available in the United States, regardless of the comparator (placebo, another medication, nonpharmacologic therapy), if they enrolled adults with insomnia disorder, provided at least 4 weeks of follow-up, and reported global or sleep outcomes. We excluded from analysis studies deemed to have high risk of bias. We included observational studies that reported harms if 1) the population included 100 or more adults with chronic insomnia without other major diagnoses, such as cancer and Parkinson disease; 2) the pharmacologic agents evaluated were FDA-indicated for insomnia and probably administered for sleep disorders; 3) study duration was at least 6 months; and 4) harms were reported by drug class. We also examined harms reported in the following: eligible trials; FDA Web sites for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem, and the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant; FDA product labels for all pharmacologic therapies; and systematic reviews. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment One investigator extracted study data, which was independently checked by a second investigator. Our main outcome of interest was patient-reported global measure of effectiveness: improvement in sleep variables and daytime functioning and distress. The 7-item ISI (score range, 0 to 28) or the 7-component, 19-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (score range, 0 to 21) were commonly used instruments measuring both problems and worry about sleep and accompanying distress or dysfunction (Table 2 of the Supplement). We also assessed sleep-specific parameters on the basis of patient-recorded sleep diaries, including SOL, TST, WASO, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, function, mood, and quality of life. Risk of bias for RCTs was independently assessed by 2 investigators using an instrument developed for this project (12). We classified overall risk of bias for each study as low, moderate, or high according to a summary of bias risk across domains and confidence that the results were believable given the study's limitations. We excluded studies with high risk of bias from analysis. Data Synthesis and Analysis We grouped studies and rated strength of evidence by drug. Evidence ratings within each comparison were determined as high, moderate, low, or insufficient (13) by at least 2 trained research associates and the principal investigator; final determinations were ascertained through consensus. For assessments of efficacy, we used established minimum important differences for main outcomes if they were available and statistical significance alone if minimum important differences were not established. We pooled results for doses approved by the FDA if more than 1 study assessed that dose, used a similar comparator (such as placebo), involved a similar study population (for example, elderly patients), and assessed similar outcomes (such as the same sleep variable). Data were analyzed in RevMan 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Center). DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were used to calculate pooled risk ratios and absolute risk differences with 95% CIs for categorical outcomes. Weighted mean differences or standardized mean differences with 95% CIs were calculated for continuous outcomes. We assessed statistical heterogeneity with the Cochran Q test and measured magnitude with the I 2 statistic (I 2> 75% indicates substantial heterogeneity) (14). We searched several databases to identify and reduce potential publication bias. Role of Funding Source This review was nominated to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Effective Healthcare Program by an anonymous individual and funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Agency staff and key informants representing various perspectives offered suggestions as we developed and refined the scope of the review. A technical expert panel provided input to the protocol and reviewed the draft report. The American College of Physicians provided support for manuscript preparation. The authors are solely responsible for its content. Results Search results are shown in the Appendix Figure. Thirty-five RCTs with acceptable risk of bias evaluated pharmacologic treatments (1546) (Figure). Six were in older adults (4247). We did not find evidence of publication bias in a search of ClinicalTrials.gov through September 2015. Eleven observational studies provided data for long-term harms (4858). Drug doses used in older adults were lower than those used in general populations. Few antidepressant or benzodiazepine trials met inclusion criteria, primarily because of short treatment durations. Patients were typically diagnosed with insomnia disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria, which require symptoms to be present for at least 1 month (current criteria require symptoms for at least 3 months).

Additional enrollment criteria were based on thresholds for SOL, TST, WASO, or number of awakenings per night during a typical night in the month before enrollment. Only 2 trials based enrollment on, or provided baseline scores of, global measures. Most required TST of 6.5 hours or less or SOL of greater than 30 minutes. When WASO was included, thresholds ranged from 30 to 120 minutes. Common exclusion criteria included psychiatric disorders or substance abuse (Tables 3 and 4 of the Supplement). Trials rarely assessed treatments for longer than 4 weeks. Most participants were women, white, and younger than 50 years. Most studies were industry-sponsored. Doses used in some trials exceeded FDA recommended doses, especially for women and older or debilitated adults (Tables 1 and 2). Table 1. Nonbenzodiazepin},

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.


METHODS
This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.


RECOMMENDATION 1
ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).


RECOMMENDATION 2
ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).},

abstract = {Insomnia is a prevalent condition, with 5% to 15% of adults meeting formal diagnostic criteria for chronic insomnia (15) (now termed insomnia disorder [6]) and one third reporting dissatisfaction with sleep. Insomnia is associated with both medical and psychiatric comorbidity, being linked to anxiety; depression (7); chronic health problems, such as hypertension (8, 9) and type 2 diabetes (10); health care use; nonmotor vehicle accidents; pain (11); and use of medication and alcohol (1215). Symptoms of insomnia have functional consequences even in the absence of a formal diagnosis (16), with the high economic burden of the condition largely mediated through the productivity cost of work absenteeism (17). Hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines and related drugs, are the most commonly used treatment for insomnia, with around 6% to 10% of U.S. adults using hypnotics in 2010 (18) and 27 daily doses of such drugs being taken per 1000 U.S. persons (19). In Australia, around 90% of primary care encounters for insomnia result in hypnotic prescription (20). Furthermore, despite a lack of evidence, use of second-generation antipsychotics (such as quetiapine) is also increasing, possibly due to patient and physician dissatisfaction with available treatments and a perceived lack of alternatives (21, 22). In this context, considering nonpharmacologic treatment options for insomnia disorder is important. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment that improves sleep outcomes with minimal adverse effects (23) and is preferred by patients to drug therapy (24). The approach to CBT-i has been refined in recent years, and it is now most commonly studied as a combined cognitive and behavioral treatment incorporating some or all of 5 components. The components are described in Table 1, and although the precise efficacy of each has not been determined, the package of care is more effective than separate delivery of the cognitive or behavioral components (25). Although previous meta-analyses have been performed (2629), no recent meta-analysis has assessed the efficacy of this now-established package of care. We present a meta-analysis of the efficacy of CBT-i on sleep diary outcomes, compared with control, for the treatment of adults with chronic insomnia. Table 1. Components of CBT-i Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, using methods from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The predetermined methods were registered online with PROSPERO (CRD42012002863) (30), with full methods presented in section 1 of the Supplement. Supplement. Supplementary Material Data Sources and Searches We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed Clinical Queries from inception to 31 March 2015 with the terms sleeplessness, chronic insomnia, insomniac, insomnia, insomni*, sleep initiation and maintenance disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioural therapies, cognitive behavioral therapies, sleep hygiene, stimulus control, relaxation, relaxation techniques, behavior modification, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, imagery, and psychotherapy in any language. We also reviewed the reference lists of 4 review articles on the topic (2628, 31) and briefly screened references by using the same search strategy without limitation to randomized, controlled trials. Study Selection Eligible studies were randomized, controlled trials involving CBT-i in adults (aged 18 years) with chronic insomnia. We defined CBT-i as multimodal therapy delivered in person on at least 2 occasions and incorporating at least 2 of the 5 most widely accepted components of CBT-i: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation therapy. For the primary analysis, acceptable control groups included sham therapy, waiting list, no treatment, sleep hygiene, or information provision. Studies were excluded if medical, sleep, or psychiatric comorbid conditions were listed as inclusion criteria, but they were not excluded on the basis of the frequency of comorbid conditions in included patients. We adopted this approach because excluding all studies that allowed patients with comorbid conditions would have markedly depleted the number of included studies, and because patients with chronic insomnia seen in clinical practice are likely to have a range of noninteracting comorbid conditions. Moreover, because only a subgroup of included studies reported the proportion of patients with comorbid conditions, we wished to avoid penalizing studies that reported in greater detail. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Two authors independently confirmed the eligibility of studies, with all discrepancies resolved by consensus. One of these 2 authors extracted data, which were verified by a third author. We contacted the corresponding author of all included studies published after 1 January 2000 to request clarification of data and methods. Study quality assessments were performed independently by the 2 authors who extracted and verified data using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (32). Data Synthesis and Analysis Our main outcome measures of interest were sleep diary measures of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE%) (Table 2). These end points were assessed at 3 time points that we defined for the purpose of this analysis: immediately after treatment, early follow-up (4 weeks to <6 months after completion of the intervention), and late follow-up (6 to 12 months after completion of the intervention). Because studies most frequently reported results as the mean and SD at a point in time rather than the SD of the mean change over time, the SD of the change over time was imputed in most cases. All analyses used random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed using the I 2 statistic and publication bias assessed with funnel plots and the Egger test (33, 34). Table 2. Glossary Six sensitivity analyses were performed that were limited to studies with particular intervention characteristics. First, we limited the analysis to studies incorporating sleep restriction because this may be among the most effective components of CBT-i (35). Second, because the optimal dosage of CBT-i is unknown but may be 4 sessions (36), we limited the analysis to studies involving at least 4 in-person contacts. Third, to consider the incremental effect of CBT-i incorporating a greater number of components, we limited the analysis to studies involving at least 4 components. Fourth, we limited the analysis to studies using a comparator group other than sleep hygiene because this may or may not be an effective stand-alone treatment (31). Fifth, we restricted the analysis to studies delivering treatment on an individual basis only, rather than in a group setting. Finally, to determine whether a tendency existed for studies with significant results to follow patients longer, we restricted the posttreatment analysis to studies with follow-up time points. In addition, we performed 3 sensitivity analyses in which we varied the correlation coefficients used to impute SDs. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, with P values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version 13.0 (StataCorp), and R, version 3.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Role of the Funding Source This study received no funding. Results Our formal search strategy identified 292 references for review of the title and abstract. Of these, the full text was obtained and reviewed for 91 articles that were considered potentially appropriate for inclusion, and 20 studies met all inclusion criteria (although only 19 contributed data to the pooled estimates presented). The study flow diagram with reasons for exclusion is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Summary of evidence search and selection. CBT-i = cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia; RCT = randomized, controlled trial. * Restricted to references not returned on MEDLINE search. Study Characteristics Table 3 shows descriptive data for the 20 included studies, which involved a total of 1162 patients (range, 20 to 201 patients), with values presented for only the groups that contributed data to this meta-analysis when possible. Most study populations were of late or middle age (mean age, 55.6 years), and 9 studies incorporated age restrictions as exclusion criteria. Sex was predominantly female (64.3%), and most studies were performed in developed countries (n= 19). Of the studies excluded on the basis of the population studied, 5 enrolled hypnotic-dependent patients, 1 enrolled obese persons, 3 enrolled patients with any comorbid condition, 1 enrolled patients with moderate to severe hot flashes, and 3 did not require a formal diagnosis of insomnia. Most studies referenced accepted definitions for insomnia (n= 17), most often an edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (n= 13), the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (n= 7), or both (Table 3). Nineteen studies excluded patients on the basis of presence of comorbid conditions, with all of these excluding patients with psychiatric or sleep-related comorbid conditions, 17 excluding those with medical comorbid conditions, 17 excluding those with medication or drug use, 4 excluding pregnant women, and 3 excluding shift workers. However, approaches differed in whether any comorbid condition was sufficient for exclusion or whether only patients with severe, unstable, or treatment-requiring conditions were excluded. Fourteen studies screened all patients with polysomnography at baseline to detect unrecognized sleep disorders. Table 3. Characteristics of Rando},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this systematic review is to provide supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline on the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adult populations.


METHODS
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of nine experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that addressed behavioral and psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the treatments produced clinically significant improvements in a range of critical and important outcomes. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to evaluate the evidence for making specific treatment recommendations.


RESULTS
The literature search identified 1274 studies; 124 studies met the inclusion criteria; 89 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. Evidence for the following interventions are presented in this review: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), Brief Therapies for Insomnia (BTIs), stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training, sleep hygiene, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining and mindfulness. This review provides a detailed summary of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits versus harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.},

abstract = {Introduction Insomnia affects up to 80% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Negative consequences of insomnia in ASD include decreased quality of life (QOL), impaired learning and cognition, increased stereotypic and challenging behaviours, and increased parental stress. Cognitive behavioural treatment for childhood insomnia (CBT-CI) is a promising treatment for dealing with insomnia and its negative consequences but has not yet been studied in school-aged children with ASD and comorbid insomnia. Access to healthcare is another challenge for children with ASD, particularly in rural and underserved regions. Previous studies indicate that ASD and insomnia share common arousal-based underpinnings, and we hypothesise that CBT-CI will reduce the hyperarousal associated with insomnia and ASD. This trial will be the first to examine CBT-CI adapted for children with ASD and will provide new information about two different modes of delivery across a variety of primary and secondary child and parent sleep and related outcomes. Knowledge obtained from this trial might allow us to develop new or modify current treatments to better target childhood insomnia and ASD. Methods and analysis Children (N=180) 6–12 years of age with ASD and insomnia will be recruited from an established autism database, a paediatric clinic and community outreach in the Columbia, MO and surrounding areas. Participants will be randomised to CBT-CI adapted for children with ASD (in-person or remote using computers with cameras) or Sleep Hygiene and Related Education. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. The following assessments will be completed regarding the children: objective and subjective sleep, daytime functioning (adaptive functioning, attention, challenging behaviours, anxiety), QOL and physiological arousal (heart rate variability) and parents: objective and subjective sleep, daytime functioning (anxiety, depression, fatigue), QOL, physiological arousal and parental burden/stress. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained in January 2020 from the University of Missouri. Ethics approval was obtained in July 2020 from the US Army Medical Research and Development Command, Office of Research Protections and Human Research Protection Office. All data are expected to be collected by 2024. Full trial results are planned to be published by 2025. Secondary analyses of baseline data will be subsequently published.
