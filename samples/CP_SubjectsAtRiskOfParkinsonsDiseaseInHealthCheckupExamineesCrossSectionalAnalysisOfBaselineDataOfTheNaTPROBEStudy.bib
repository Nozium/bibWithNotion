abstract = {Clinical studies have shown that up to 90% of patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) will eventually be diagnosed with a clinical α‐synucleinopathy. Because of this high conversion rate, screening for RBD is often performed to identify eligible participants for studies aimed at elucidating the prodromal phase of α‐synucleinopathies. However, screening for RBD, especially in the general population, raises many ethical dilemmas. In light of the existing ethical literature and our experience in establishing a screening approach for RBD in the Rotterdam Study, we discuss ethical dilemmas when screening for RBD in population‐based studies. We conclude that informing study participants about the reason for invitation and the possible trajectory that lies ahead when participating is essential. However, participants should not be troubled unnecessarily by giving them detailed information about possible diagnoses or associated disease risks. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

abstract = {Background The Bradykinesia Akinesia Incoordination (BRAIN) test is a computer keyboard-tapping task that was developed for use in assessing the effect of symptomatic treatment on motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). An online version has now been designed for use in a wider clinical context and the research setting. Methods Validation of the online BRAIN test was undertaken in 58 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 93 age-matched, non-neurological controls. Kinesia scores (KS30, number of key taps in 30 seconds), akinesia times (AT30, mean dwell time on each key in milliseconds), incoordination scores (IS30, variance of travelling time between key presses) and dysmetria scores (DS30, accuracy of key presses) were compared between groups. These parameters were correlated against total motor scores and sub-scores from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Results Mean KS30, AT30 and IS30 were significantly different between PD patients and controls (p≤0.0001). Sensitivity for 85% specificity was 50% for KS30, 40% for AT30 and 29% for IS30. KS30, AT30 and IS30 correlated significantly with UPDRS total motor scores (r = −0.53, r = 0.27 and r = 0.28 respectively) and motor UPDRS sub-scores. The reliability of KS30, AT30 and DS30 was good on repeated testing. Conclusions The BRAIN test is a reliable, convenient test of upper limb motor function that can be used routinely in the outpatient clinic, at home and in clinical trials. In addition, it can be used as an objective longitudinal measurement of emerging motor dysfunction for the prediction of PD in at-risk cohorts.},

abstract = {Whilst the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) relies on the motor triad of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, the underlying pathological process starts many years before these signs are overt. In this prodromal phase of PD, a diverse range of non‐motor and motor features can occur. Individually they do not allow a diagnosis of PD, but when considered together, they reflect the gradual development of the clinical syndrome. Different subgroups within the prodromal phase may exist and reflect different underlying pathology. Here, we summarise the evidence on the prodromal phase of PD in patient groups at increased risk of PD with well described prodromal features: patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, patients with idiopathic anosmia and families with monogenic mutations that are closely linked to PD pathology. In addition, we discuss the information on prodromal features from ongoing studies aimed at detecting prodromal PD in the general population. It is likely that better delineation of the clinical prodromes of PD and their progression in these high‐risk groups will improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES
To provide an overall estimate of the prevalence of idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD).


METHODS
Two investigators have independently searched the PubMed and Scopus databases for population-based studies assessing the prevalence of iRBD. Data about type of diagnosis (polysomnographic diagnosis, defined iRBD [dRBD]; clinical diagnosis, probable RBD [pRBD]), continent, age range of the screened population, quality of the studies, sample size, screening questionnaires and strategies have been gathered. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Heterogeneity was investigated with subgroup analysis and meta-regression.


RESULTS
From 857 articles found in the databases, 19 articles were selected for the systematic review and meta-analysis. According to the type of diagnosis, five studies identified dRBD cases given a pooled prevalence of 0.68% (95%CI 0.38-1.05) without significant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q p=0.11; I 2 = 46.43%). Fourteen studies assessed the prevalence of pRBD with a pooled estimate of 5.65% (95%CI 4.29-7.18) and a significant heterogeneity among the studies (Cochran's Q p<0.001; I 2 = 98.21%). At the subgroup analysis, significant differences in terms of prevalence were present according to the quality of the studies and, after removing two outlaying studies, according to the continents and the screening questionnaire used. Meta-regression did not identify any significant effect of the covariates on the pooled estimates.


CONCLUSION
Prevalence estimates of iRBD are significantly impacted by diagnostic level of certainty. Variations in pRBD prevalence are due to methodological differences in study design and screening questionnaires employed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Antidepressants, among the most commonly prescribed medications, trigger symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in up to 6% of users. Idiopathic RBD is a very strong prodromal marker of Parkinson disease and other synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative syndromes. It is therefore critically important to understand whether antidepressant-associated RBD is an independent pharmacologic syndrome or a sign of possible prodromal neurodegeneration.


DESIGN
Prospective cohort study.


SETTING
Tertiary sleep disorders center.


PARTICIPANTS
100 patients with idiopathic RBD, all with diagnosis confirmed on polysomnography, stratified to baseline antidepressant use, with 45 matched controls.


MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS
Of 100 patients, 27 were taking antidepressants. Compared to matched controls, RBD patients taking antidepressants demonstrated significant abnormalities of 12/14 neurodegenerative markers tested, including olfaction (P = 0.007), color vision (P = 0.004), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale II and III (P < 0.001 and 0.007), timed up-and-go (P = 0.003), alternate tap test (P = 0.002), Purdue Pegboard (P = 0.007), systolic blood pressure drop (P = 0.029), erectile dysfunction (P = 0.002), constipation (P = 0.003), depression indices (P < 0.001), and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (13% vs. 60%, P < 0.001). All these abnormalities were indistinguishable in severity from RBD patients not taking antidepressants. However, on prospective follow-up, RBD patients taking antidepressants had a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disease than those without antidepressant use (5-year risk = 22% vs. 59%, RR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.74).


CONCLUSIONS
Although patients with antidepressant-associated RBD have a lower risk of neurodegeneration than patients with "purely-idiopathic" RBD, markers of prodromal neurodegeneration are still clearly present. Development of RBD with antidepressants can be an early signal of an underlying neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Bradykinesia is the defining motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). There are limitations to its assessment using standard clinical rating scales, especially in the early stages of PD when a floor effect may be observed.


OBJECTIVE
To develop a quantitative method to track repetitive tapping movements and to compare people in the early stages of PD, healthy controls, and individuals with idiopathic anosmia.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional study of 99 participants (early-stage PD = 26, controls = 64, idiopathic anosmia = 9). For each participant, repetitive finger tapping was recorded over 20 seconds using a smartphone at 240 frames per second. From each video, amplitude between fingers, frequency (number of taps per second), and velocity (distance travelled per second) was extracted. Clinical assessment was based on the motor section of the MDS-UPDRS.


RESULTS
People in the early stage of PD performed the task with slower velocity (p <  0.001) and with greater frequency slope than controls (p = 0.003). The combination of reduced velocity and greater frequency slope obtained the best accuracy to separate early-stage PD from controls based on metric thresholds alone (AUC = 0.88). Individuals with anosmia exhibited slower velocity (p = 0.001) and smaller amplitude (p <  0.001) compared with controls.


CONCLUSION
We present a simple, proof-of-concept method to detect early motor dysfunction in PD. Mean tap velocity appeared to be the best parameter to differentiate patients with PD from controls. Patients with anosmia also showed detectable differences in motor performance compared with controls which may suggest that some are in the prodromal phase of PD.},

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative condition that has significant costs to the individual patient and to society. The pathology starts up to a decade before symptoms are severe enough to allow a diagnosis using current criteria. Although the search for disease-modifying treatment continues, it is vital to understand what the right time is for diagnosis. Diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is based on the classic clinical criteria, but the presence of other clinical features and disease biomarkers may allow earlier diagnosis, at least in a research setting. In this review, we identify the benefits of an early diagnosis, including before the classic clinical features occur. However, picking the right point for a “timely” diagnosis will vary depending on the preferences of the individual patient, efficacy (or existence) of disease-modifying treatment, and the ability for health systems to provide support and management for individuals at every stage of the disease. Good evidence for the quality-of-life benefits of existing symptomatic treatment supports the argument for earlier diagnosis at a time when symptoms are already present. This argument would be significantly bolstered by the development of disease-modifying treatments. Benefits of early diagnosis and treatment would affect not only the individual (and their families) but also the wider society and the research community. Ultimately, however, shared decision-making and the principles of autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence will need to be applied on an individual basis when considering a “timely” diagnosis.},

url = {https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9859b0bdcd728f0ebe65d2fe8bc837e2b5a3c504},
abstract = {Background: We previously created the PREDIGT Score as an algorithm to predict the incidence of Parkinson disease. The model rests on a hypothesis-driven formula, [PR=(E+D+I)xGxT], that uses numerical values for five categories known to modulate Parkinson's risk (PR): environmental exposure (E); DNA variants (D); evidence of gene-environment interactions (I); gender (G); and time (T). Notably, the formula does not rely on motor examination results. Methods: To evaluate the PREDIGT Score, we tested it in two established case-control cohorts: 'De Novo Parkinson Study' (DeNoPa) and 'Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative' (PPMI). Using baseline data from 589 patients and 309 controls enrolled in the DeNoPa and PPMI cohorts, we evaluated the PREDIGT Score's discriminative performance in distinguishing Parkinson's patients from healthy controls by area-under-the-curve (AUC) analyses. Findings: When examining cohorts separately and using all available variables in each cohort to calculate the PREDIGT Score, AUCs were 0.83 (95% CI 0.77-0.89) for DeNoPa and 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.9) for PPMI, respectively, in distinguishing Parkinson disease patients from healthy individuals. When combining DeNoPa and PPMI data sets by using eleven variables that had been collected in both cohorts, the PREDIGT Score discriminated patients from controls with an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.87). The mean score of Parkinson disease patients was significantly higher than that of control individuals at 108.48 (+/-52.08) and 47.33 (+/-34.1), respectively (p < 0.0001). Interpretation: Our results demonstrate a robust performance of the original PREDIGT Score in distinguishing patients diagnosed with Parkinson disease from neurologically healthy subjects without reliance on motor examination data. In future efforts, the predictive performance of the algorithm will be studied in longitudinal cohorts of at-risk persons. Funding: Parkinson Canada, Michael J.

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) among a general population of elderly Japanese people.


METHODS
This epidemiological study targeted 2714 elderly residents (76.0±8.0 yr, 52.9% female) of a rural community. Questionnaires including the REM sleep behavior disorder single question and demographic information were distributed. All respondents with the question positive were interviewed by telephone. Respondents suspected of having iRBD proceeded to face-to-face interviews and underwent video-polysomnography and neurological / neuropsychological examination. These results were compared to those of previously diagnosed clinical iRBD patients in our sleep clinic.


RESULTS
Of 1464 respondents to the questionnaire, 18 respondents were diagnosed as iRBD (1.23 [0.66-1.79]%), including 8 respondents who satisfied diagnostic criteria with REM sleep without atonia (RWA) above the cut-off value (0.54 [0.17-0.92]%) and 10 respondents who had clear dream enactment behaviors but not RWA above the cut-off (provisionally diagnosed iRBD; p-iRBD) (0.69 [0.26-1.11]%). Severity of RBD and RWA of the population-based iRBD were compatible with those of the clinical iRBD. Half of the population-based iRBD showed orthostatic hypotension and they showed lower olfactory function than population-based p-iRBD and non-RBD. However, their olfactory and cognitive functions were higher than those in the clinical iRBD patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Prevalence of iRBD in Japanese elderly people was comparable with the rate reported from other countries. Population-based iRBD / p-iRBD showed lower neurodegenerative loading than clinical iRBD in spite of comparable disease duration of RBD, that may indicate their lower risk of future neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a major shift in our understanding of the course of Parkinson’s disease (PD) from a disease of the brain to a disease of long latency, characterized by the progressive emergence of multiple non-motor symptoms, including hyposmia, constipation, depression, anxiety, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as subtle motor signs, before the typical motor signs appear. Epidemiological studies have made major contributions by allowing better characterization of subsequent PD risk in relation to non-motor symptoms. Such findings have profound implications for the conduct of epidemiological studies examining risk and protective factors in PD, and the interpretation of their findings. Given the length of the prodromal period, reverse causation in particular is a major concern with many reported associations. One striking feature of PD etiology, compared with other diseases, is the presence of numerous inverse associations. If these associations are truly causal, they would have major implications for disease prevention and for slowing disease progression. However, whether these associations are truly causal remains to be demonstrated in future studies. Experimental studies play an important role by offering a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Well-designed epidemiological studies using innovative approaches will also be key in elucidating whether these intriguing associations are causal or a consequence of reverse causation. # 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Background: Hyposmia, motor impairment and probable REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) are markers for Parkinson9s disease (PD). Proposed PD risk prediction models have dichotomised test results and applied likelihood ratios (LRs) to scores above and below cut-offs. We investigate whether LRs for specific test values could enhance prediction models. 
Methods: Smell and probable RBD data for PD patients were taken from the Tracking Parkinson9s study (n=1046). For motor impairment previously published data were supplemented (n=87). PREDICT-PD pilot study participants were the controls. Smell, motor impairment and RBD were assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Bradykinesia-Akinesia Incoordination (BRAIN) test and the REM sleep behaviour disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). UPSIT and RBDSQ data were analysed using logistic regression to determine which items were predictive of PD, or using total scores. Gaussian distributions were fitted to BRAIN test scores. LRs were calculated from logistic regression models or from score distributions. False-positive rates (FPRs) for specified detection rates (DRs) were calculated.
Results: Logistic regression modelling yielded a greater range of LRs. 16 odours were associated with PD; LRs ranged from 0.005-5511. 6 RBDSQ questions were associated with PD; LRs ranged from from 0.34-69. BRAIN test LRs ranged from 0.16-1311. For a 70% DR the FPR for the 16 odours was 2.4%, for 50% DRs, the BRAIN test FPR was 6.6% and 12.2% for the RBDSQ. 
Conclusions: Maximising information on PD markers can potentially improve the ability of algorithms to detect PD by generating LRs with a larger range of values than using dichotomised results.},

abstract = {Prevalence & clinical spectrum Parkinson’s disease (PD) is considered a paradigmatic movement disorder where parkinsonism, defined by the presence of bradykinesia plus at least one additional motor sign out of rest tremor, rigidity and impaired postural reflexes, is the anchor of current clinical criteria [1]. The neuropathological diagnosis of PD requires the presence of Lewy body degeneration with cell loss in the substantia nigra leading to striatal dopamine deficiency. The pathology of PD, however, is much more widespread, involving a multitude of brain areas beyond the nigrostriatal dopamine system, many of which are not primarily involved in motor control including brain stem nuclei such as the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, dorsal vagal nucleus and other ponto-medullary cell groups, the bulbus and tractus olfactorius and piriform cortex, large parts of the limbic and neocortex, the diencephalon, thalamus and also extend to the peripheral autonomic nervous system [2]. It is therefore not surprising that nonmotor symptoms (NMS) form an integral part of the clinical spectrum of PD: the PPRIAMO study – a multicenter assessment of NMS and their impact on quality of life in PD surveying more than 1100 patients with PD in different stages of their disease – found that overall 98.6% of the patients with PD reported the presence of one or several NMS [2]. NMS become more frequent with prolonged disease duration, and dementia, hallucinosis, depression, urinary incontinence and orthostatic hypotension were found in 50–80% of the patients with disease duration of more than 15 years [3,4]. NMS may escape attention unless specifically interrogated, as demonstrated in a recent hospital-based survey using the Non-Motor Symptom Questionnaire, which identified an average of 11 NMS per patients as opposed to less than five that had been captured in routine case notes of these subjects [5], the most common being nycturia, urgency, memory impairment, constipation and depressed mood. Apart from being common in advanced stages of disease, NMS may be a presenting symptom of PD, preceding the full expression of classical motor signs. A recent study found that 21% of a PD sample had presented in that fashion and NMS presentation was associated with delayed diagnosis [6]. NMS are a significant contributor to overall disability and disease burden, as exemplified by cognitive decline and dementia, which have been associated with a more rapid progression of disability, increased risk for nursing home care and mortality [4] or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, which is one of the major risk factors of falls in PD [7]. Some studies have found closer correlations with Quality of Life scores of NMS compared with motor symptom rating scores [8].},

abstract = {Objective The PREDICT-PD study aims to identify increased risk of Parkinson’'s disease (PD) using online assessments of previously identified risk and early features of PD and an evidence-based scoring algorithm. We sought to determine whether higher risk participants (defined as those above the 15th centile of risk estimates) were more likely to have mild parkinsonian signs compared with lower risk participants. Methods Video recordings of neurological examinations, including the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III, of 208 individuals who had previously completed an online risk assessment were scored blindly and independently by two movement-disorders experts. Higher risk and lower risk subjects were compared for MDS-UPDRS part III score (and derivations of this) to identify subclinical parkinsonism, and association of risk estimates with MDS-UPDRS III scores assessed. Results Higher risk subjects had significantly higher median UPDRS part III scores (3, IQR 1–5.5) than lower risk subjects (1, IQR 0–3.0; p<0.001), and there was a significantly greater proportion of individuals classified as having subclinical parkinsonism. 18% of the higher risk subjects and 6% of the lower risk subjects exceeded the most stringent published cut-off for subtle parkinsonism of three definitions examined (p=0.027). Linear regression analysis demonstrated a continuous relationship of log-transformed risk estimates with UPDRS part III scores (increase in MDS-UPDRS per doubling of odds 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72; p<0.001), which remained after adjustment for multiple vascular risk factors and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.87; p<0.001). Conclusions The PREDICT-PD algorithm identifies a population with an increased rate of motor disturbances.},

abstract = {Objectives Few studies have evaluated the presence of multiple nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in relation to Parkinson disease (PD). Therefore, we examined cross-sectional associations between individual and multiple NMS and PD in the Agricultural Health Study. Methods 20,473 male farmers and 16,259 female spouses provided information on six NMS (reduced sense of smell, dream-enacting behavior, daytime sleepiness, infrequent bowel movement, depression, and anxiety) in the cohort’s 2013–2015 follow-up survey. 191 men and 68 women reported physician-diagnosed PD. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable logistic regression models separately by sex. Results NMS were each associated with PD, with the strongest association for reduced sense of smell in men and dream-enacting behavior in women. The number of NMS showed a strong dose-response relationship with PD, particularly in men. ORs were 5.5 (95% CI 3.4–8.8) for one, 17 (95% CI 10.4–28.0) for two, and 53.4 (95% CI 33.2–86.1) for three or more NMS in men; the corresponding ORs were 4.6 (95% CI 2.3–9.5), 6.7 (95% CI 2.9–15.6), and 23.6 (95% CI 10.7–52.4) in women (PNMS-interaction-with-sex = 0.07). Conclusions The number of NMS was associated with PD in a dose-response manner and the association appeared stronger in men than in women. These findings should be further investigated in population-based prospective studies.},

abstract = {Objectives To present methods and baseline results for an online screening tool to identify increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in the UK population. Methods Risk estimates for future PD were derived from the results of a systematic review of risk factors and early features of PD. Participants aged 60–80 years without PD were recruited by self-referral. They completed an online survey (including family history, non-motor symptoms and lifestyle factors), a keyboard-tapping task and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Risk scores were calculated based on survey answers. Preliminary support for the validity of this algorithm was assessed by comparing those estimated to be higher risk for PD with those at lower risk using proxies, including smell loss, REM-sleep behaviour disorder and reduced tapping speed, and by assessing associations in the whole group. Results 1324 eligible participants completed the survey and 1146 undertook the keyboard-tapping task. Smell tests were sent to 1065 participants. Comparing the 100 highest-risk participants and 100 lowest-risk participants, median University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test scores were 30/40 versus 33/40 (p<0.001), mean number of key taps in 30 s were 55 versus 58 (p=0.045), and 24% versus 10% scored above cut-off for REM-sleep behaviour disorder (p=0.008). Regression analyses showed increasing risk scores were associated with worse scores in the three proxies across the whole group (p≤0.001). Conclusions PREDICT-PD is the first study to systematically combine risk factors for PD in the general population. Validity to predict risk of PD will be tested through longitudinal follow-up of incident PD diagnosis.},

Cases (n=120) had confirmed PD, were<85 in January 2012, returned a 2012 questionnaire with questions on probable rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and constipation sent to all cohort participants and completed in 2014 the Brief Smell Identification Test and a questionnaire assessing parkinsonism and other non-motor PD features (including depressive symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired colour vision and body pain). Controls (n=6479) met the same criteria as cases, except for the PD diagnosis. Results Concurrent constipation, probable RBD and hyposmia were present in 29.3% of cases and 1.1% of controls, yielding an age-adjusted OR of 160(95%CI 72.8to353) for three features versus none. The odds of PD increased exponentially with additional non-motor features (OR for 6–7 features versus none: 1325; 95%CI333to5279). Among men without PD, the number of non-motor features was associated with odds of parkinsonism (OR for 6–7 features versus none: 89; 95%CI21.2to375). We estimated that in a population with a prodromal PD prevalence of 2%, concurrent constipation, probable RBD and hyposmia would have a maximum sensitivity of 29% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 35%. The PPV could increase up to 70% by including additional features, but with sharply decreased sensitivity. Conclusions Concurrent constipation, probable RBD and hyposmia are strongly associated with PD. Because these features often precede motor symptoms and their co-occurrence could provide an efficient method for early PD identification.},

abstract = {This article describes research criteria and probability methodology for the diagnosis of prodromal PD. Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but classic clinical diagnosis based on fully evolved motor parkinsonism is not yet possible. Given the lack of clear neuroprotective/disease‐modifying therapy for prodromal PD, these criteria were developed for research purposes only. The criteria are based upon the likelihood of prodromal disease being present with probable prodromal PD defined as ≥80% certainty. Certainty estimates rely upon calculation of an individual's risk of having prodromal PD, using a Bayesian naïve classifier. In this methodology, a previous probability of prodromal disease is delineated based upon age. Then, the probability of prodromal PD is calculated by adding diagnostic information, expressed as likelihood ratios. This diagnostic information combines estimates of background risk (from environmental risk factors and genetic findings) and results of diagnostic marker testing. In order to be included, diagnostic markers had to have prospective evidence documenting ability to predict clinical PD. They include motor and nonmotor clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and ancillary diagnostic tests. These criteria represent a first step in the formal delineation of early stages of PD and will require constant updating as more information becomes available. © 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

abstract = {Background: The prevalence of dream enactment behavior and other risk factors for a parkinsonian disorder is not well documented. Methods: A survey on prevalence of parkinsonism risk factors was designed using two validated instruments (REM behavior disorder single item question, bowel movement frequency for constipation) and three exploratory instruments (for hallucinations, cognitive and olfactory complaints.) It was sent by mail and email to patients aged 50 and over at two University of Utah community clinics in Salt Lake City. A total of 7888 unique patients were sent the survey, and 1607 responses were recorded (response rate 20%). Those whose age was missing (n = 117) or less than 50 years (n = 10) were excluded from the analysis. Results: Of the 1406 without personal diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease 62.7% were female, and median age was 63. Family history (FH) of Parkinson’s disease was endorsed by 9%, constipation (defined as a bowel movement less than once per day) by 19%, mild cognitive complaints (MCI) 15.8%, dream enactment 13.7%, subjective hyposmia or anosmia 18.2%, and at least one potential psychotic symptom in 37.6%. Multivariable logistic regression showed male gender, mild cognitive complaints, hearing voices, and at least one potentially psychotic symptom to be significantly associated with dream enactment. Conclusions: This survey shows that dream enactment, a strong predictor of risk for synucleinopathy, is relatively common in the older population; because such individuals rarely come to medical attention of a sleep clinic, such survey research may be useful to identify and recruit at-risk individuals for trials aimed at preventing neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Background: The detection of prodromal Parkinson’s disease (PD) is desirable to test drugs with neuroprotective potential, but will be affected by known disease variations. Objective: To assess the prevalence of four key non-motor prodromal PD markers, and evaluate the sensitivity of case detection when non-motor screening tools for prodromal PD are implemented in an early clinical PD cohort. Methods: Hyposmia (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test ≤15th centile or Sniffin’ Sticks at or ≤10th centile corrected for age and sex), rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD questionnaire >4), constipation (<1 daily spontaneous bowel motion) and depression (Leeds >6) were recorded in recent onset PD cases, and proposed non-motor screening criteria applied. Results: In 1,719 PD cases, mean age 68.6 years (SD 8.1), 65.5% male, mean disease duration 1.3 years (SD 0.9), 72.2% were hyposmic, 43.3% had RBD, 22.1% depression, and 21.5% constipation. 11.6% of cases had no key non-motor features, 38.8% one, 32.1% two, 15.5% three, and 2.0% all four. Increasing numbers of non-motor features were associated with younger age (p = 0.019), higher motor scores (p < 0.001), more postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) (p < 0.001), greater cognitive impairment (p < 0.001) and higher total non-motor burden (p < 0.001). Cases with hyposmia alone were younger (p < 0.001), had less severe cognitive (p = 0.006) and other non-motor features (p < 0.001). All screening criteria selected younger patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001), three of four greater overall non-motor burden (p = 0.005, p < 0.001), and inclusion of RBD more cognitive impairment (p = 0.003, p = 0.001) and PIGD (p = 0.004, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Varying sensitivity levels, and age and phenotype selectivity, are found when different non-motor screening methods to detect prodromal PD are applied to an early clinical PD cohort.},

abstract = {This article describes research criteria and probability methodology for the diagnosis of prodromal PD. Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but classic clinical diagnosis based on fully evolved motor parkinsonism is not yet possible. Given the lack of clear neuroprotective/disease-modifying therapy for prodromal PD, these criteria were developed for research purposes only. The criteria are based upon the likelihood of prodromal disease being present with probable prodromal PD defined as 80% certainty. Certainty estimates rely upon calculation of an individual’s risk of having prodromal PD, using a Bayesian na€ıve classifier. In this methodology, a previous probability of prodromal disease is delineated based upon age. Then, the probability of prodromal PD is calculated by adding diagnostic information, expressed as likelihood ratios. This diagnostic information combines estimates of background risk (from environmental risk factors and genetic findings) and results of diagnostic marker testing. In order to be included, diagnostic markers had to have prospective evidence documenting ability to predict clinical PD. They include motor and nonmotor clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and ancillary diagnostic tests. These criteria represent a first step in the formal delineation of early stages of PD and will require constant updating as more information becomes available.

abstract = {Objective: To determine the predictive value of clinical assessment and dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake for the early development of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy diseases from idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) over 5 years in a Chinese population. Methods: Forty-three patients with iRBD were administered clinical assessment tests, and 35 were examined by DAT-SPECT imaging during 2011. Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of the markers in a follow-up study over 5 years. Results: Eighteen patients (41.9%) developed neurodegenerative synucleinopathy diseases after a median of 4.1 years of prospective follow-up (median interval of 10.5 years from the estimated onset of iRBD symptoms). Patients with higher scores on the Nonmotor Symptom Questionnaire (hazard ratio [HR] 3.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–8.40, p = 0.026) and Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson Disease–Autonomic questionnaire (HR 4.46, 95% CI 1.64–12.10, p = 0.003) were more likely to develop neurodegenerative synucleinopathy diseases. Furthermore, the population with decreased 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding in the left striatum (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.02–7.14, p = 0.046) and putamen (HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.16–8.33, p = 0.024) had a relatively higher risk of developing neurodegenerative synucleinopathy diseases. Conclusions: Our findings elucidate the predictive value of autonomic dysfunction and DAT uptake in identifying patients with iRBD at a high risk of progressing into neurodegenerative synucleinopathy diseases and could form a basis for future disease-prevention trials.},

abstract = {. The neuropatho -logical diagnosis of PD requires the pres-ence of Lewy body degeneration with cell loss in the substantia nigra leading to stri-atal dopamine deficiency. The pathology of PD, however, is much more widespread, involving a multitude of brain areas beyond the nigrostriatal dopamine system, many of which are not primarily involved in motor control including brain stem nuclei such as the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, dorsal vagal nucleus and other ponto-medullary cell groups, the bulbus and tractus olfacto -rius and piriform cortex, large parts of the limbic and neocortex, the diencephalon, thalamus and also extend to the peripheral autonomic nervous system},

abstract = {Abstract In order to calibrate stem cell exploitation for cellular therapy in neurodegenerative diseases, fundamental and preclinical research in NHP (nonhuman primate) models is crucial. Indeed, it is consensually recognized that it is not possible to directly extrapolate results obtained in rodent models to human patients. A large diversity of neurological pathologies should benefit from cellular therapy based on neural differentiation of stem cells. In the context of this special issue of Primate Biology on NHP stem cells, we describe past and recent advances on cell replacement in the NHP model of Parkinson's disease (PD). From the different grafting procedures to the various cell types transplanted, we review here diverse approaches for cell-replacement therapy and their related therapeutic potential on behavior and function in the NHP model of PD.},
